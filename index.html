        <h1>Specificity and Sensitivity Translator</h1>

        <p>Specificity and sensitivity are confusing words. Not only is it hard to remember which is which, it's hard to get a handle on what they mean, since the actual
           probabilties are based the <b>prevalence</b> of the disease in society. This page is a minimal calculator. Given a test's specificity and sensitivity and assumed prevalence, 
           it will tell you how likely you are to have the disease (or antibodies) if you get a positive or negative result.

        <p><b>Caution: </b> This page was made by a total novice, based on advice from someone who knows stats but not medical research. Please don't make medical decisions based on the calculations on this page.</p>
        
        <p>Additionally, any input for assumed prevalence is inherently speculative. This introduces a lot of garbabe into these calculations.</p>
